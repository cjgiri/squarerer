# Squarerer

## MVP

Squarerer is a browser game inspired by the popular iPhone game '1010!'. In the game, players must form complete rows of squares in a ten by ten grid to 'clear' that row. Points are given based on how many pieces are placed on the board. The player loses when they can no longer place any of the pieces they hold onto the grid.

* [ ] Complete basic game functionality, with drag and drop tile placement

## Phases

### Phase one
Phase one will implement the core row-clearing and tile-dragging mechanics on the HTML canvas.

### Phase two
After the basic game functionality is implemented, I will consider and implement my specific variations on the core game mechanic, such as a timer, grid variants, or novel tile delivery functionality.

### Phase three
Phase three will add the final layer of styling polish, including menus and robust, useful pages for end of game scenarios.
